				Hi there! I am Stella! I was born in Macao and came to the States at the age of 12. My last name is just U. I often get invalid messages because they assume I put in an abbreviation. I have one big fat cat, he is turning 10 this year. That is equivalent to human age 56. coool

				I believe one can't stop learning throughout their lifetime. There are just too much to learn -- not just knowledge from books, but also getting wiser from life experience. Two years ago, I gave myself a challenge and went on a backpacking trip in Europe. I visited 10 countries and 20 cities in five weeks. It was truly an eye-opener. I didn't only learned about their cultures but also discovered much more of myself!! I would like to share with you here!!!!
